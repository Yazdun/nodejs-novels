## About The Project

You can create, update, delete, read and much more cool stuff with your favourite novels and authors with Novels API. This API has three separate routings which are `admin` , `protected` and `public` .

- with admin routes you can perform CRUD funcionalities and also view analytics and managements.
- with protected routes you can sign up and login as a user, create reviews and rate novels, like novels give your favourite authors a star and much more cool stuffs !
- with public routes, you can view authors and novels as an unregistered user.

I have also built two separate frontend user interfaces for this project, one of them is dedicated to admin panel and second one is dedicated to public and protected routes. You can check their source code following the links below üëá
